# Cause vs Effect

In this challenge, you will put into practice everything you just learned in the `Cause vs Effect` lesson of the **Clean Code** course.

# About the challenge

The code in which you will practice these concepts contains logic from a React component that makes a call to a function that returns user data.

While user data is not returned, the `Loading` behavior is displayed on the screen so that the screen does not go blank.

Your objective in this code is not to correct or implement its operation, as it already works, but you must rename variables or even object attributes according to what was learned, giving meaning to the variables according to the rules above.
